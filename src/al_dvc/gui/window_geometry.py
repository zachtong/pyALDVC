"""Keep dialogs fully on screen.

A modal ``QDialog`` created with a parent window has no taskbar button, so if
it opens off-screen -- taller than a small display, or centred on a window that
sits near a screen edge or on a since-disconnected monitor -- the user can
neither move, reach, nor close it, and (being modal) the whole application
looks frozen.  ``fit_dialog_to_screen`` clamps the dialog to the usable screen
area and repositions it, centred on its parent, so the title bar and its close
button always stay reachable.

The size/position maths lives in the pure :func:`fitted_geometry` helper so it
can be unit-tested without a display (``QRect`` is a value type and needs no
``QApplication``).
